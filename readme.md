# TheTasks

Another macOS app for managing tasks. This one is as minimalist as I can get. You add tasks, and they carry over from day to day until you finish them. No project management, and no tags (at the moment). The tasks persist via Core Data, and sync via iCloud.

I use this to export work tasks once a week for record keeping. Tasks won’t export unless you make them exportable.

Soon as I can install macOS 13 and iOS 16, I’ll port this to the new SwiftUI navigation system so I can make an iOS version.
